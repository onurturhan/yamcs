This contains an example with a Yamcs server with two instances node1 and node2 with the data replicating from node1(Master) to node2(Slave).
node1 is acting as a TCP client and node2 is TCP server (this is the difference vs the replication1 example).

The two instances can be separated on two different Yamcs servers by copying the instance configuration file. 

In addition the ReplicationServer global service in yamcs.yaml has to be defined on the node2 (TCP server) side.

To run execute mvn yamcs:run in this directory. 
Connecting via a web-browser, you can go to nodeX->Archive->Streams and observe the stream count.
The node1 data links counters are incrementing with the data recieved via the simulator while node2 data links are not connected.
