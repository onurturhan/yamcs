Processors
==========

Yamcs processes TM/TC according to Mission Database definitions. Yamcs supports concurrent processing of parallel streams; one processing context is called *Processor*. Processors have clients that receive TM and send TC. Typically one Yamcs instance contains one realtime processor processing data coming in realtime and on-request replay processors, processing data from the archive. Internally, Yamcs creates a replay processors for tasks like filling up the Parameter Archive.

Each processor is composed of a set of services with varying functionality.
