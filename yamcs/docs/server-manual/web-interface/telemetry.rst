Telemetry
=========

The Telemetry group within the Yamcs web interface provides access to monitoring-related pages.

Parameters
----------

This page lists all parameters. Each parameter can be accessed individually to see the latest or archived values. Numeric parameters can also be charted.


Displays
--------

Shows the displays or display resources that are known by Yamcs Server for the selected instance. The displays in this view are presented in a file browser with the usual operations to rename, move or create. Clicking on a display file opens the display. If there is incoming telemetry this will be received by the opened display file.
