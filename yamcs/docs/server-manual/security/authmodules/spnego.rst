SPNEGO AuthModule
=================

This AuthModule supports Single Sign On authentication of users via SPNEGO. This is usually stacked together with the :doc:`kerberos` module in case the single sign on does not work, or in case Yamcs is accessed from a non-web context.

Configuration Options
---------------------

principal (string)
    | **Required.** Kerberos Service Principal of the HTTP service that matches the external address of Yamcs.
    | This should be in the format ``HTTP/<host>.<domain>@<realm>``

keytab (string)
    | **Required.** Path to the keytab file matching the principal.

stripRealm (boolean)
    | Whether to strip the realm from the username (e.g. ``user@<realm>`` becomes just ``user``).
    | Default: ``true``.

This module reads Kerberos configuration from the Kerberos system configuration file. This is usually available at ``/etc/krb5.conf``. If you need to override this location, you have to set a system property at JVM level:

    -Djava.security.krb5.conf=/my/custom/krb5.conf
