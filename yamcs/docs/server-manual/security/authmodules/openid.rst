OpenID Connect AuthModule
=========================

.. versionadded:: 5.0.0

This AuthModule supports federated identity by redirecting web application users to the authorization (or consent) page of an OpenID Connect server. This allows for remote management of users and could be used to perform cross-domain Single Sign On with multiple other browser applications.

This AuthModule is used for authentication only. It does not directly support importing roles. But you could do so by extending this module.

Configuration Options
---------------------

authorizationEndpoint (string)
    **Required.** The URL of the OpenID server page where to redirect users for authorization and/or consent.

tokenEndpoint (string)
    **Required.** The URL of the OpenID server page where OAuth2 tokens can be retrieved.

clientId (string)
    **Required.** An identifier that identifies your Yamcs server installation as a client against the Open ID server. This should be set up using the configuration tools of the Open ID server.

clientSecret (string)
    **Required.** The secret matching with the ``clientId``.

scope (string)
    Space-separated scope to be used in authorization request. Default: ``openid email profile``

attributes (map)
    Configure how claims are mapped to Yamcs attributes. If unset, Yamcs uses defaults that work out of the box against some common OpenID Connect providers.


Attributes sub-configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

name (string or string[])
    The claim that matches with the account name. This is used internally by Yamcs to map the user to a single identity. If multiples are defined, they are tried in order. Default: ``[preferred_username, nickname, email]``.

email (string or string[])
    The claim that matches with the email. If multiples are defined, they are tried in order. Default: ``email``.

displayName (string or string[])
    The claim that matches with the display name. If multiples are defined, they are tried in order. Default: ``name``.


.. rubric:: Note to third-party developers

This AuthModule implements the conventions for server-side web applications. In other words: the ``id_token`` is retrieved and decoded on Yamcs server only. Before Yamcs can obtain the ``id_token`` it expects to be given some information by the integrating application.

The source code of the Yamcs web interface serves as the best reference. But generally it works like this:

#. The browser application retrieves OpenID Connect options on the ``/auth`` endpoint. This includes the ``client_id``, the ``authorizationEndpoint`` and the ``scope``. Other configuration options are reserved for server use.

#. The browser application uses the ``authorizationEndpoint`` to redirect the browser to a login or consent page of the  upstream OIDC server. The following is an example:
   
   .. code-block:: JavaScript

       window.location.href = "https://oidc.example.com" +
               "?client_id=encodeURIComponent(CLIENT_ID)" +
               "&state=encodeURIComponent(STATE)" +
               "&response_mode=query" +
               "&response_type=code" +
               "&scope=openid+email+profile" +
               "&redirect_uri=encodeURIComponent(REDIRECT_URI)";
    
   ``STATE`` can be anything, and is typically used for encoding information about the original request such that when the authentication is done, the user is redirected back to the original attempted route.

   ``REDIRECT_URI`` is the path where OIDC will redirect back the user after the login or consent is confirmed.

#. When OIDC redirects the user's browser back to REDIRECT_URI, extract the ``code`` and ``state`` from the query params.

#. Use this upstream ``code`` to make an encoded string like this:

   .. code-block:: JavaScript

       var codeForYamcs = "oidc " + JWT;

   Here, JWT represent a JSON Web Token that stringifies a payload containing at least these properties:

   .. code-block:: text

       {
         "redirect_uri": REDIRECT_URI,
         "code": UPSTREAM_CODE,
       }

#. The string value of the variable ``codeForYamcs`` can be used against the Yamcs ``/auth`` endpoint using ``grant_type=authorization_code`` for converting it to a standard Yamcs-level access token.

   In the background what happens is that Yamcs will use the upstream code and exchange it against OIDC for an ``id_token`` which tells Yamcs what the username, email and display name are for the authenticated user. The ``redirect_uri`` property is not actually used anymore, but most OIDC servers will check on this being specified and matching the original ``redirect_uri`` used for obtaining the upstream code.
