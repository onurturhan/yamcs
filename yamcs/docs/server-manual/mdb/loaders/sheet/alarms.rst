Alarms Sheet
============

This sheet defines how the monitoring results of a parameter should be derived. E.g. if a parameter exceeds some pre-defined value, this parameter's state changes to ``CRITICAL``.

parameter name
    The reference name of the parameter for which this alarm definition applies

context
    A condition under which the defined triggers apply. This can be used to define multiple different sets of triggers for one and the same parameter, that apply depending on some other condition (typically a state of some kind). When left blank, the defined set of conditions are assumed to be part of the *default* context.

    Contextual alarms are evaluated from top to bottom, until a match is found. If no context conditions apply, the default context applies.

report
    When alarms under the given context should be reported. Should be one of ``OnSeverityChange`` or ``OnValueChange``. With ``OnSeverityChange`` being the default. The condition ``OnValueChange`` will check value changes based on the engineering values. It can also be applied to a parameter without any defined severity levels, in which case an event will be generated with every change in value.

minimum violations
    Number of successive instances that meet any of the alarm conditions under the given context before the alarm event triggers (defaults to 1). This field affects when an event is generated (i.e. only after X violations). It does not affect the monitoring result associated with each parameter. That would still be out of limits, even after a first violation.

watch: trigger type
    One of ``low``, ``high`` or ``state``. For each context of a numeric parameter, you can have both a low and a high trigger that lead to the ``WATCH`` state. For each context of an enumerated parameter, you can have multiple state triggers that lead to the ``WATCH`` state.

watch: trigger value
    If the trigger type is ``low`` or ``high``: a numeric value indicating the low resp. high limit value. The value is considered inclusive with respect to its nominal range. For example, a low limit of 20, will have a ``WATCH`` alarm if and only if its value is smaller than 20.

    If the trigger value is ``state``: a state that would bring the given parameter in its ``WATCH`` state.

warning: trigger type, warning: trigger value
    Analogous to ``watch`` condition

distress: trigger type, distress: trigger value
    Analogous to ``watch`` condition

critical: trigger type, critical: trigger value
    Analogous to ``watch`` condition

severe: trigger type, severe: trigger value
    Analogous to ``watch`` condition
