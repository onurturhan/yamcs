The spreadsheet loader loads TM/TC definitions from an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet structure must follow a specific structure. The advantage of this loader is that the Excel files are very convenient to modify with any spreadsheet program. It is recommended to start from an existing example and replace its content as required.

The Excel file must be in Excel 97-2003 Format (``.xls``). ``.xlsx`` is not supported.
