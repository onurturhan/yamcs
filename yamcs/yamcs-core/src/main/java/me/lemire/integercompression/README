This is integer compression code copied from 
https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR

We copied it here (instead of using the library via Maven) because we want 
to make sure that we control 100% the format of the archive data and do not want 
to have some incompatibility by later upgrading the library to a newer version.

In addition we copied just the classes that we actually use.
