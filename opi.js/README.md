# opi.js

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40yamcs%2Fopi.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yamcs/opi)

This is a JavaScript library for rendering Yamcs Operator Interfaces (OPI) in a web browser.

An OPI is a file in XML format that describes a synoptic display for the monitoring and control of systems.

This library is a side project of [Yamcs Mission Control](https://yamcs.org) for use in its web interface. Operators can upload and monitor synoptic displays where widgets are connected to telemetry delivered by Yamcs.

## Limitations

Compared to the Yamcs Studio desktop software, this library has these limitations:

- No edit support
- No Python scripts (use JavaScript instead)
- No access to Java code from within scripts
- Scripts cannot access the local file system

And as this library is in incubation phase, many widgets are not or not fully supported.

## Acknowledgments

The OPI display format originates from [Control System Studio](https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/cs-studio), an Eclipse RCP product. The implementation in this repository ports many of their routines.

Note that compatibility with Control System Studio is not an objective of this library. Instead we follow the display format of Yamcs Studio -- a fork of Control System Studio.
